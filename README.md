Project Title: Green Connect – An Online Community for Sharing and Selling Extra Plants
Green Connect serves as an innovative and meaningful solution to a real and growing problem faced by plant enthusiasts and home gardeners. By providing an accessible platform for sharing, selling, and exchanging surplus plants, the project promotes sustainability, reduces plant waste, and encourages environmentally friendly practices. More importantly, it builds a supportive community where users can connect, learn, and contribute to urban greening efforts.
Through its user-friendly design and purpose-driven features—such as plant listings, category-wise browsing, direct communication, and a community forum—Green Connect successfully bridges the gap between people with excess plants and those eager to grow their gardens.
Overall, this project not only supports the ecological benefits of plant-sharing but also fosters a collaborative and eco-conscious culture. Green Connect stands as a practical, impactful, and community-cantered platform that encourages people to grow together—both in nature and in connection
